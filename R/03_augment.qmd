## Augmenting data

We transform the values contained in the column "Behavior" into binary variables, so that stimulated mice are assigned 1 and non-stimulated 0 in the new column "Stimulated".

We also move to the first positions the columns that describe the conditions of the mice, excluding "class" since it only summarises the others.

```{r}
df_aug <- df_clean |>
  mutate(Stimulated = case_when(Behavior == "C/S" ~ 1,
                                Behavior == "S/C" ~ 0)) |>
  select(MouseID, Genotype, Treatment, Stimulated, DYRK1A_N:CaNA_N)
```
